# e-portfolio
To discover who I am and who I want to be, I propose a game.

--------------------------------------------------------------
TEMPORARY

You will find my presentation video, my diploma and other documents in
the folder called 'documents'

--------------------------------------------------------------


TO PLAY TO MY GAME

You will have to download this folder called 'e\_portfolio'.
Then you unzip it and look in the folder called 'game\_folder'.

Two choices :

    - if you are on windows without acces to a linux setup you 
    can double click on 'programme.exe' (WARNING : this is a test
    version so there are some problems with the window which twinkles.
    I'm warning epileptic peaple and I'm sorry).

    - if you have an linux setup : you can open the folder called 'game_folder'
    and write './prog' in your terminal to start the game.

I hope you will enjoy it.  ;)
